# go-264

`go-264` is an H.264/AVC decoder written in Go. The pinned regression stream produces the same visible Y, U and V samples as FFmpeg 7.1.3 for all 300 frames in display order, including in-loop deblocking.

The decoder targets progressive 8-bit YUV420 Annex B streams. The repository also contains scalar reference code, amd64 and arm64 assembly hooks, trace tools and optional GPU experiments.

## Why

I wanted a dead simple, `ffmpeg`-free way to extract selected frames from videos as quickly as possible on low-end hardware, and a reusable library/stack to build upon for later video work.

## Tested features

| Area | Tested behaviour |
|---|---|
| Annex B and NAL parsing | Start-code scanning, emulation-prevention removal and bounded SPS/PPS parsing |
| Slice syntax | I, P and B headers; POC; reference marking; P-list modification; weighted-prediction fields; deblocking controls; I_PCM |
| CAVLC | Baseline decoding and High-profile inter 8x8 residual scans |
| CABAC | I, P and B macroblocks; residuals; reference and motion-vector contexts; 8x8 transforms; I_PCM reset |
| Intra prediction | I4x4, I8x8, I16x16 and chroma prediction modes |
| Inter prediction | P and B partitions, quarter-sample luma, chroma interpolation, Direct mode and weighted prediction used by the pinned stream |
| Transforms | Scalar 4x4 and 8x8 integer transforms with assembly dispatch hooks |
| Frame handling | DPB reference tracking, POC handling and display ordering across IDR GOPs |
| Deblocking | Scalar in-loop luma and chroma filtering |

The pinned stream does not exercise every legal H.264 combination. FMO reconstruction, uncommon weighted B-prediction modes, interlaced and MBAFF streams, chroma formats other than 4:2:0 and bit depths above 8 are unsupported or untested. The project does not contain an encoder.

## Build

```bash
go build -o /workspace/tmp/decode264 ./cmd/decode264
```

## Decode an Annex B stream

```bash
/workspace/tmp/decode264 -i input.h264 -o frames -f color
/workspace/tmp/decode264 -i input.h264 -o frames -f png
/workspace/tmp/decode264 -i input.h264 -o frames -f yuv
```

Output formats:

* `color` writes one colour PNG per display-order frame.
* `png` writes one luma-only PNG per display-order frame.
* `yuv` writes one planar YUV420 file per display-order frame.

Use `-frames N` to limit decoding. The default value, zero, decodes the complete stream.

### Input validation and resource limits

Construct library decoders with `decode.NewDecoder()`. `Decode` rejects malformed
Annex B headers, truncated syntax and incomplete pictures. It requires progressive
8-bit YUV420. Multiple slices are assembled into one picture, with slice-aware
prediction, constrained intra prediction and per-slice deblocking controls.
Each call must end at a complete picture; partial-picture streaming is not supported.

P-picture short-term references use the active SPS frame-number modulus, including
wrap, list modifications and explicitly signaled gaps. Inferred gap pictures hold
metadata only: attempting to predict from one returns an error. Unannounced gaps
are errors, not automatic packet-loss concealment. POC types 0/1/2, frame-number
and POC wrap, IDR/MMCO-5 resets, long-term references, P-list modification
operations 0/1/2 and ordered MMCO commands 1–6 are supported. B pictures involving
long-term references (including co-located long-term motion) or inferred gaps
remain explicitly unsupported.

`Decode` returns pictures in decoding order. `POC` and `FullPOC` both contain the
derived picture order count, not the raw POC-LSB syntax value.
`ResetsPictureOrder` identifies IDR/MMCO-5 boundaries; `NoOutputOfPriorPics`
preserves the IDR flag for consumers managing a display-order queue. The CLI
sorts pictures within each POC epoch.

`Decoder.MaxFrameMacroblocks` bounds the coded picture before pixel or macroblock
state allocation. Zero uses `decode.DefaultMaxFrameMacroblocks` (36,864). Set a
positive value to choose another budget within the parser and frame-storage
limits. Cropping does not reduce the coded allocation.

The batch API retains outputs in `Decoder.Frames`; `MaxFrames` limits one call,
not the lifetime of a reused decoder.

## FFmpeg parity test

The parity test uses this fixture:

```text
Path:       /workspace/tmp/bbb_annexb.h264
SHA-256:    1305bc99a369721c46e35e3af8cc3e5f893f653eb6f472830bc70f6fcf3841ff
Format:     640x360, yuv420p, High profile, CABAC, three B-frames
Frames:     300
Reference:  FFmpeg 7.1.3
```

`scripts/bootstrap_fixtures.sh` verifies fixtures in `/workspace/tmp`. It can encode missing fixtures with the installed FFmpeg and libx264. The hash check rejects output from an incompatible toolchain, so retain a verified fixture when repeatable byte-for-byte generation matters.

Run the CABAC event comparison:

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap_fixtures.sh
./scripts/cabac_firstdiv.sh \
  /workspace/tmp/testsrc_cabac_p.h264 \
  /workspace/tmp/go264-cabac-firstdiv
```

The accepted trace contains 2,100 events from each decoder and no differing compared field.

Run the pixel comparison:

```bash
GO264_FFMPEG_REGRESSION=1 \
GO264_FFMPEG_BIN=/workspace/tmp/ffmpeg-7.1.3/ffmpeg \
GO264_BBB_FIXTURE=/workspace/tmp/bbb_annexb.h264 \
go test ./cmd/decode264 -run TestFFmpegReferenceParityBBB -count=1 -v
```

`TestFFmpegReferenceParityBBB` checks the fixture hash, FFmpeg version, frame count, display order and every visible sample in the Y, U and V planes. A failure reports the first differing frame, plane, macroblock and pixel. The accepted result has `maxdiff=0` for all three planes over all 300 frames.

Compare files produced by a separate decoder run with a contiguous FFmpeg rawvideo file:

```bash
scripts/compare_yuv_frames.py \
  --go-dir /workspace/tmp/bbb-go \
  --reference /workspace/tmp/bbb-ffmpeg.yuv \
  --width 640 \
  --height 360 \
  --frames 300
```

## Validation

Use a workspace-backed Go temporary directory on systems where `/tmp` is mounted with `noexec`:

```bash
export TMPDIR=/workspace/tmp
export GOTMPDIR=/workspace/tmp/go-264
mkdir -p "$GOTMPDIR"

go test ./...
go vet ./...
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build ./...
git diff --check
```

Run the one-frame CABAC reconstruction check when changing entropy or reconstruction code:

```bash
FFMPEG=/workspace/tmp/ffmpeg-7.1.3/ffmpeg \
./scripts/cabac_parity_baseline.sh \
  /workspace/tmp/testsrc_cabac_p.h264 \
  /workspace/tmp/go264-cabac-parity-baseline
```

The accepted result is `99.00dB` and `maxdiff=0` for Y, U and V.

## Trace tools

`trace264 -cabac` emits macroblock events from the decoder. Scripts under `scripts/` can instrument a local FFmpeg 7.1.3 source tree and compare CABAC, Direct-mode, motion-cache and reconstruction state. Store output directories under `/workspace/tmp` because raw frames and trace files can be large.

Available decoder traces include:

| Variable | Output |
|---|---|
| `GO264_CABAC_ARITH_TRACE=1` | CABAC arithmetic state |
| `GO264_CABAC_CBP_TRACE=1` | Coded-block-pattern decisions |
| `GO264_CABAC_RESIDUAL_TRACE=1` | Residual significance, last flags and levels |
| `GO264_CABAC_SYNTAX_TRACE=1` | Intra syntax bins |
| `GO264_RECON_TRACE=1` | Prediction, coefficient, residual and output checksums |
| `GO264_DIRECT_TRACE=1` | Spatial and temporal Direct derivation |

Trace text is an internal diagnostic format and may change.

## Performance

Existing fast paths cover bit reading without emulation-prevention bytes, CAVLC prefix lookup, interior and axis-aligned motion compensation, integer-motion sub-rectangle copies, chroma row copies, zero-residual bypasses and direct frame-row writes.

Historical development-host BBB runs measured 44-52ms per decode after the allocation work described in Git history. Current benchmark results depend on the selected benchmark, fixture, hardware, Go version and build flags; record the complete command and compare results from the same host.

```bash
go test ./decode -run '^$' -bench BenchmarkDecode -benchmem
```

## Generate entropy tables

```bash
go generate ./entropy/cabac ./entropy/cavlc
```

The generators live under `internal/tables/` and use the `//go:build ignore` constraint. Generated CABAC and CAVLC tables are checked in.
